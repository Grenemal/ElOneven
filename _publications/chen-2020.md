# STORM imaging of mitochondrial dynamics using a vicinal-dithiol-proteins-targeted probe

## Abstract

Stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM) is a promising method for the visualization of ultra-fine mitochondrial structures. However, this approach is limited to monitoring dynamic intracellular events owing to its low temporal resolution. We developed a new strategy to capture mitochondrial dynamics using a compressed sensing STORM algorithm following raw data pre-treatments by a noise-corrected principal component analysis and K-factor image factorization. Using STORM microscopy with a vicinal-dithiol-proteins targeting probe, visualizing mitochondrial dynamics was attainable with spatial and temporal resolutions of 45 nm and 0.8 s, notably, dynamic mitochondrial tubulation retraction of ~746 nm in 1.2 s was monitored. The labeled conjugate was observed as clusters (radii, ~90 nm) distributed on the outer mitochondrial membranes, not yet reported as far as we know. This strategy is promising for the quantitative analysis of intracellular behaviors below the optical diffraction limit.

## Graphical abstract

A new STORM probe was developed to selectively label vicinal dithiol proteins on the outer mitochondrial membrane, achieved STORM imaging of mitochondrial dynamics in live cells. By pre-treating with a noise-correction-principal-component-analysis and a K-factorization algorithm, a compressed sensing algorithm achieved STORM imaging with enhanced temporal resolution. Mitochondrial dynamics, were visualized with ultra-fine details to facilitate the studies on mitochondrial functions in live cells at resolutions beyond the optical diffraction limit.

## Introduction

Mitochondria are characterized by highly interconnected networks and dynamic changes [1]. The formation and maintenance of mitochondrial networks are mediated by the fusion of individual mitochondria and junctions between tubules [2]. Dynamic changes in the fusion-fission balance and mitochondrial tubular network formation determine the overall morphology and biological behaviors of mitochondria. Furthermore, in a process referred to as dynamic tubulation, tubules stretch to fuse with the membranes of other mitochondria [3]. These dynamic events facilitate the maintenance of normal mitochondrial functions, such as the interchange of mitochondrial materials, DNA integrity, respiratory capacity, response to cellular stress, and apoptosis [4]. However, disruptions in mitochondrial dynamics lead to abnormal development and human diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders and cancers [5]. Therefore, investigations of mitochondrial dynamics are critical to enable a deeper understanding of diseases related to mitochondrial dysfunctions.

Fluorescence microscopy is widely used to investigate single mitochondria in live cells [6]. However, imaging mitochondrial substructures using conventional optical microscopy is limited by the optical diffraction limit. Since the emergence of super-resolution imaging, it has become feasible to visualize ultra-fine structures [7]. Stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM) has an outstanding imaging ability for biological objects below 200 nm in size [8]. Fluorescent probes composed of fluorophores (e.g., Alexa647) and antibodies are favored for STORM imaging in fixed cells [9,10]. However, live cell imaging by STORM remains challenging owing to the lack of appropriate probes and low temporal resolution. In particular, direct STORM has rarely been used to evaluate mitochondrial dynamics.

Smart fluorescent probes that selectively target mitochondrial membrane-bound proteins would facilitate the imaging of mitochondrial membrane structures using STORM. Mitochondria possess abundant vicinal dithiol proteins (VDPs) with two proximal cysteine residues in their primary structures; they play essential roles in maintaining mitochondrial redox homeostasis, antioxidant defense, and redox signaling. Fluorescent arsenicals contain a 1, 3, 2-dithiarsenolane moiety capable of selectively binding to VDPs by forming covalent bonds [11]. They can label mitochondrial VDPs in situ, providing a basis for the application of STORM to mitochondria in live cells [12]. However, STORM involves sparse lighting and dilute labeling with fluorescent probes during sample preparation, and thousands of frames are needed to reconstruct a super-resolution image, resulting in poor temporal resolution [13,14]. Temporal resolution can be improved by reducing the number of frames. Compressed sensing STORM (CSSTORM) is an l1-norm minimization-based multi-molecule localization algorithm and is more suitable for dense fluorescence than single-molecule fitting. It can substantially shorten the time required for signal acquisition by cutting the number of required frames, and the temporal resolution can be further improved by increasing the acquisition frame rate of the electron multiplying charge coupled device (EMCCD) [15]. However, the rapid signal acquisition will increase background noise, thereby increasing interference in image reconstruction. For the application of STORM to live cell mitochondrial dynamics, the development of smart probes targeting mitochondrial membrane VDPs with an improved reconstruction algorithm for noise suppression is a promising strategy.

In this work, we performed STORM imaging of mitochondrial dynamics in live cells, and carried out the quantitative analysis of the target under STORM super-resolution microscopy. A new fluorescent marker suitable for STORM imaging was developed to selectively label VDPs on the outer mitochondrial membrane by simple co-culturing with cells. Meanwhile, we employed a moderate illuminating laser power to obtain as much single-frame emitter localiztion as possible and to reduce photobleaching and phototoxicity. The temporal resolution of STORM imaging can be achieved by reducing the laser power and increasing the CCD frame rate. To avoid interference from background noises, a combination of noise-corrected principal component analysis (NC-PCA) and K-factor image factorization were developed to treat the raw data prior to reconstruction using the CSSTORM algorithm. The principle and implementation of the algorithms were further described in the Supplemental Information (Figs. S14â€“S17). Using this strategy, we achieved STORM imaging of mitochondrial dynamics including fusion, fission, and mitochondrial tubulation. Furthermore, the VDP distribution on the outer mitochondrial membrane was quantitatively evaluated by hierarchical clustering analysis under STORM imaging.
